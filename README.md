# Prime Number Finder
A multiprocessing and multithreading C++ program to find and list prime numbers between two given input integers. There are 2 different versions of the main program and some additional preparation codes are also available.  

## General Information
There are 7 different programs, the first 5 files have preparation codes and the last 2 files are the 2 different versions of the final program:
1. **1_Memset_Memcpy_Vectors.cpp**: memset() and memcpy() executions on vectors.
2. **2_Shared_Memory_Forks.cpp**: Forks with shared memory.
3. **3_Shared_Memory_Arrays.cpp**: Arrays in shared memory.
4. **4_Shared_Memory_Vectors.cpp**: Vectors in shared memory.
5. **5_Data_Distribution_on_Threads.cpp**: Distributing a number of samples with multiple processes and threads.
6. **6_Prime_Number_Finder_v1.cpp**: Finding prime numbers between two integers in multiple processes and threads (version-1).
7. **7_Prime_Number_Finder_v2.cpp**: Finding prime numbers between two integers in multiple processes and threads (version-2).

## Setup & Run
Compile the programs with **g++** and run the generated output files:
```
g++ filename.cpp
```
